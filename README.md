## 📂 Contents

Here are the topics covered:

1. **Array Creation**  
2. **Data Manipulation – Part 1**  
3. **Data Manipulation – Part 2**  
4. **Useful Functions in NumPy**  
5. **Broadcasting and Universal Functions (ufuncs)**  
6. **Mathematical Operations**  
7. **Datasets folder** for real-time examples

Each notebook has code + explanation. You can run them in Jupyter or Colab.

## 💬 Why This Repo?

I wanted to learn NumPy in a structured way—starting from arrays to math functions. So I made these notebooks and shared them here. Good for:

- Beginners in Data Science
- People who want to revise NumPy basics
- Students doing mini projects or EDA

---

## 📌 Note

- You can use the `Datasets/` folder to try NumPy on real data.
- Try running notebooks cell by cell for better understanding.
